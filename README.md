Static webiste written in html and css (and small amount of JavaScript for hiding nav bar) without any optimization of picture loading.
To wiew this just open the index.html file in your bwroser, or acces it on http://www.hifiklubliberec.cz/.
I was just triing to replicate a old design from Wordpress, improove it and add some new content.

I learned a lot about html and I first met wit JavaScript, but I found out that pure html is not what I want to wrtie, so next projects are in Flask or Next.js.
